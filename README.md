# FabJava Complex System

This Java project demonstrates a modular architecture:
- `auth`, `config`: Sensitive credentials and settings
- `db`: Database access with JDBC
- `service`: Business logic layer
- `utils`: Utility functions like logging and hashing
- `cli`: Command-line interface entry

**Caution**: Contains hardcoded credentials for demo purposes.
